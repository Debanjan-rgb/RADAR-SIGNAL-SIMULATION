# RADAR-SIGNAL-SIMULATION
# Radar Signal Simulation using Python

This project simulates a simple radar system using Python. It generates a radar chirp signal, simulates the echo from a target, and estimates the distance of the object using signal processing techniques.

## Project Description

Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging) systems use electromagnetic waves to detect objects and measure their distance. In this project, we simulate the following:

- Transmission of a chirp signal
- Reception of an echo with time delay and attenuation
- Estimation of the time delay using cross-correlation
- Calculation of the target's distance

## Concepts Used

- Chirp Signal (Linear Frequency Modulation)
- Speed of Light and Time Delay
- Signal Delay Simulation
- Cross-Correlation
- Target Distance Calculation
